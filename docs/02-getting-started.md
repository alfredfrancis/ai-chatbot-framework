# Getting started

## Understanding Key Concepts

### Intents

Intents are the building blocks of your chatbot's understanding - they define what your bot can recognize and how it should respond. An intent represents a specific action or request that users might make.

For example, when a user asks "What's the weather like today?", the intent would be "check_weather".

### Entities

Entities are specific pieces of information that you want to extract from user messages. For example, in the message "Book a table for 4 people at 7 PM", "4" (number of people) and "7 PM" (time) are entities.

### Channels

Channels are the platforms where your chatbot can be accessed. They can be web, or social media platforms like Facebook Messenger.

## Admin Panel

The admin panel serves as the central hub for managing your chatbot. You can use it for following:

- Configure and manage intents
- Create and edit entities
- Train your chatbot
- Test conversations in real-time
- Monitor conversation logs
- Manage Channel integrations

Access the admin panel at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) after starting the application.
